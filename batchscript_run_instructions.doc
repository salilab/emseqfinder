Step 1: Add Input Files
Inside the base folder, you should have the following subfolders:
- pdb_files/ → contains .pdb structure files
- cryoem_maps/ → contains .map density files
- fasta_files/ → contains .fasta sequence files

Step 2: Inside the reference folder please unzip the ref.mrc.zip and place ref.mrc file inside reference folder directly.

Place your input data into the respective folders with same name.
Step 3: Run the Pipeline
Run the EMSequenceFinder shell script to start processing all inputs:

bash emseqfinder.sh

Make sure the script has executable permission:
chmod +x emseqfinder.sh
Step 5: Output Files
Upon successful execution, the following output files will be generated:
- *_ML_side_ML_prob.dat → contains fragment-wise sequence scores
- batch_matching_results.txt → contains overall sequence matching accuracy per structure.
